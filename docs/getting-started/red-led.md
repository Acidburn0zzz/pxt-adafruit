## Red LED

Your first challenge is to light up the red [LED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode)

#### ~hint

You can use the [red LED](/reference/light/red-LED) block to turn the built in LED **on** or **off**. 

Setting the red LED to **true** switches it on. 

Setting the red LED to **false** switches it off.
