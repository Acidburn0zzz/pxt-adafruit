## If Statements

In this challenge, you'll use an **if** block to turn on the red LED if the left button is pressed.

#### ~hint

An **if** block takes in a **condition**. This condition needs to be true in order for the code inside the **if** block to be run.

Let's show the red LED if the left button is clicked. 
We will need to place our code inside a **while** block, so that it continiously checks if we have met the condition.

1. Drag a **while** block from the **Loops** drawer onto the workspace. 
2. Find the **if** block. Hint: Look inside the **Logic** drawer.
3. Drag an **if** block and place it inside the **while** block.
4. Find the **left button pressed?** block. Hint: Look inside the **Sensors** drawer.
5. Drag the **left button pressed?** block and connect it to the if statement, putting it in place of the **true** dropdown. 
6. Drag the **red LED** block and place it inside the **if** block. 
7. Tap on the left button in the simulator to test your code.
