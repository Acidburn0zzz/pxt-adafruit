## Animations

Previously we learnt about showing pre-made drawings on the @boardname@. 

Let's look at how we can show pre-made animations. 

#### ~hint

You can use the **show Animation** block to show a pre-made animation.

This block will play a single frame of the animation, so it will need to be placed inside a **while** block to run continiously.

```sig
light.showAnimation(Animation.RainbowCycle)
```

Let's show a Rainbow animation.

1. Find the **show Animation** block. Hint: Look inside the **Light** drawer.
2. Drag the block so that it is inside a **while** block, and set it to show the **RainbowCycle** animation.
3. Check your result in the simulator.

Try out some of the other pre-made animations. They are super cool!
