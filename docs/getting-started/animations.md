## Animations

Previously we leart about showing premade drawings on the @boardname@. 
Let's look at how we can show premade animations. 

#### ~hint

You can use the **show animation (Animation)** block to show a premade animation.
This block will play a single frame of the animation, so it will need to be placed inside a **while** block to run continiously.

Let's show a Rainbow animation.

1. Find the **show animation (Animation)** block. Hint: Look inside the **Lights** drawer.
2. Drag the block so that it is inside a **while** block, and set it to show the **Rainbow** animation.
3. Check your result in the simulator

Try out some of the other premade animations. They are super cool!
