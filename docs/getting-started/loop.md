## Loop

So far, you've learned how to light up the red LED and show pre-made drawings on the Neopixels.

In the next few challenges, you'll need to use the **while** block to repeatedly run some blocks. 

```block
while (true) {
    
}
```

This is also known as a while loop.
Anything you place inside the **while** block, will run over and over forever.

You can find the **while** block inside the **Loops** drawer.
