## Sensors

The @boardname@ has many built in sensors. Let's try out some of these sensors. 
Let's use the previous example as a starting point.

Replace the **left button pressed?** with the **slide switch** block from the **Sensors** drawer. 
Try this a few times with some of the other sensors in the **Sensors** drawer. 

#### ~hint

For some of the sensors, including the light and sound sensors. We have a special way of simulating these in the simulator. 
When you add these sensor blocks into your workspace, a slider for the respective sensor will appear in the simulator allowing you to adjust that sensor's input value.
