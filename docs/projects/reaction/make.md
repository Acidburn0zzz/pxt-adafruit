## Duration: ~ 1 hour 

## Step 1: Creating the wristband for the battery pack 

1. From your piece of paper. measure and cut a strip that is approximately 3 inches x 10 inches. It's okay if your strip is longer or shorter than 10 inches!

2. Using duct tape, cover both sides of this strip with tape. Get creative and decorate the strip however you want! If you choose to put more stickers on or use glue, make sure that you leave space on the left side of the strip for velcros, as well as a rectangle in the middle about 3 inches wide so that you can still attach your battery pack.

3. After decoration, paste on 2 velcro sqaures or circles to the top and the bottom of the LEFT side of the strip.

4. Flip the strip over on the long end. Place the other side of the velcro squares or circles on the RIGHT side of the flipped-over strip.

5. Flip the strip back over. You should have a strip with 2 velcros on the LEFT side facing up at you. The velcros on the RIGHT side should NOT be seen unless you flip the strip back over. 

6. Cut a piece of cardboard 4.5 inches x 2 inches. Once again, this doesn't have to be exact :)

7. With the piece of cardboard, lay your battery pack in the center of the cardboard. Your setup should look like this!

8. Use the shape of the battery pack to press the cardboard - your cardboard should turn into a "U" - shape around the battery pack. Here's a video demonstrating of how to do this!

9. Using the hot glue gun, attach the two flaps onto the wristband. Leave the battery pack in place- this will help you determine how far apart to glue the flaps so that the battery pack can fit snugly into the cardboard.

10. If you have any scrap cardboard left, cut a small rectangle out so you can glue it to the bottom of your folded cardboard. Here's a video demonstrating what we did!

11. Your wristband is now done! Let's get on to making the hand strap for your circuit player.

## Step 2: Creating the hand strap for @boardname@ 

1. Cut a strip of paper that is approximately 2.5 x 9.5 inches.

2. Fold 3 inches of the paper from the short side in.

3. Using scissors, on the fold, cut a half circle to a half oval. This creates a hole for your thumb so that you can wear this hand strap!

4. Unfold your paper. You should have a full circle now! If the circle looks too small for your thumb, refold your paper and cut a bigger half circle.

5. Using duct tape, cover the inside of the circle so that you won't have to worry about the paper cutting your thumb.

6. Now, use your duct tape and creative side to finish covering both sides of the strip with duct tape! Remember to leave the thumb hole uncovered from tape. 

7. Taking two velcro squares or cicles, paste them on the right side of the thumb hole you've cut. 

8. Flip the strip over on its long side, and paste the opposite sides of these velcros on the left side. 

9. Attach 1-2 velcros on your @boardname@. If your velcros are bigger, use 1! If smaller, use 2. In this example. we attached 2 to our @boardname@. 

10. Place the opposite sides of the velro in the center of your hand strap.
